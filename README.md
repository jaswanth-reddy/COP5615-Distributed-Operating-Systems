# COP5615-Distributed-Operating-Systems
Concepts and techniques for efficient management of computer system resources.


Course Objectives:

Students will study design principles, computing paradigms, and communication protocols for modern distributed systems and their underlying distributed and network operating systems. 
Successful students will be able to discuss the spectrum of distributed operating systems, design and implement a distributed system, evaluate a given design vis-à-vis a particular purpose, and apply their knowledge of data structures, algorithms, performance analysis, and protocols to real-life problems in multi-threaded, distributed systems.
